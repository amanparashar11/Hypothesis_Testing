**Question 1: Food Standards Agency Interventions – **

**The Scenario**


This question asks you to prepare a report for politicians and managers of the Food Standards Agency.
The data provided contains one row for each local authority in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Establishments within each local authority are rated for their potential impact on public
health (essentially a measure of how many people could they cause sickness to, and how seriously, if they serve bad food). These ratings are letter grades from A – meaning the greatest potential impact – to E – the lowest potential impact upon public health. They are then inspected to check whether they are compliant with hygiene and food safety laws. If they fail to meet the level of “broadly compliant” with these laws then the local authority gives them an intervention. This requires them to make changes and fix the problems so that they become compliant with the law. If the establishment achieves the requirements of the intervention then they are permitted to continue operating.

**The Request**


We are interested in whether establishments successfully respond to intervention actions.
Create a plot that clearly shows the distribution across the Local Authorities (LAs) of the % of enforcement actions successfully achieved. You should create one version that shows this for all impact levels combined, and one that shows the distributions separately for establishments rated A, B, C, D and E.
We are interested in whether employing more professional enforcement officers increases the likelihood of establishments successfully responding to enforcement actions. Examine whether there is a relationship between proportion of successful responses and the number of FTE food safety employees in each local authority. You should use the value from `ProfessionalFullTimeEquivalentPosts-occupied` to represent the number of employees. Also examine whether there is a relationship between proportion of successful responses and the number of employees as a proportion of the number of establishments in the local authority – essentially creating your own measure of how many food safety employees there are per
establishment.



**Question 2: Book Sales**


**The Scenario**



This question asks you to prepare a report for the managers of a publishing company.
The data provided contains information on e-book sales over a period of many months. Each row in the data represents one book. The values of the variables are taken across the entire time period, so daily.sales is the average number of sales (minus refunds) across all days in the period, and sale.price is the average price for which the book sold across all sales in the period.



**The Request**


The management team would like you to provide a report that addresses the following: Do books from different genres have different daily sales on average?
Do books have more/fewer sales depending upon their average review scores and total number of reviews.
What is the effect of sale price upon the number of sales, and is this different across genres?
